// Practice Problem on map(), filter(), find(), reduce

/*1) You have an odd array(array with odd numbers).[1, 3, 5, 7, 9].Now convert this array into an even array (array with even
numbers). [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]. Do this using for loop & array.map()
method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it will become an even
number.*/


/*
2) You are given an array say: [33, 50, 79, 78, 90, 101, 30 ]. Now
return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using
array.filter() method.
*/

/*
3) Now do the same task of question 2. But do this using array.find()
method. Then compare the output of question 2 & question 3.
*/



/*
4) You have an array [ 1, 9, 17, 22 ]. Add the all elements
of this array and give output. Do this using for loop &
array.reduce() method.

/*
// practice Problem on reduce
    const people = [
        {name: "Menna", age: 20},
        {name: "Rina", age: 15},
        {name: "Suchorita", age: 22},
    ];

5)Challenging: Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects as
array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?

20 + 15 + 22 = 57 . The output will be 57

What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with for loop. I know you can do it.
But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method.
